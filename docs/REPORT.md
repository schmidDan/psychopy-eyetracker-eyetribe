# REPORT — progress log

Append-only; one section per phase (see DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md section 6).

## Phase 0 — Repository scaffold & fact verification  (status: DONE — pending PR review/merge)
- Date: 2026-06-15
- Delivered:
  - Repo structure per section 5: packaging (`pyproject.toml` with both entry-point groups),
    `MANIFEST.in`, `LICENSE` (GPL-3.0), `README`, `CHANGELOG`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `.gitignore`,
    `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, CI + release workflows (Windows).
  - PsychoPy-free core stubs (`eyetribe_client`, `frames`, `transforms`, `time_sync`, `calibration`)
    that import without PsychoPy; lazy `EyeTracker` export (PEP 562) in `eyetribe/__init__.py`;
    `EyeTracker` and `EyeTribeEyetrackerBackend` stubs so both entry points resolve; valid device YAML;
    `MockEyeTribeServer` stub.
  - Tests: core import tests, entry-point registration + YAML-parse tests (PsychoPy-free), and
    PsychoPy-gated discovery/loader test; pre-Phase-0 hardware smoke script (`tests/manual/smoke_socket.py`).
  - `docs/REFERENCES.md` skeleton with CONFIRMED vs TO-CONFIRM items.
- Acceptance criteria status:
  - PASS (sandbox): ruff/black/isort clean; PsychoPy-free tests green; entry points + YAML verified.
  - PENDING (Windows + PsychoPy 2026.1.3): `pip install -e .[dev]`; full CI green; namespace
    `psychopy.iohub.devices.eyetracker.hw.eyetribe` resolves; ioHub loader test; complete REFERENCES.md.
- TO-CONFIRM handed forward: items marked [TO CONFIRM ON MACHINE] in `docs/REFERENCES.md`.
- **Hardware pre-flight gate (8a smoke), 2026-06-15: PASS** — ET1000 + Eye Tribe Server 0.9.77 stream
  at 30 Hz (1920×1080), `trackerstate 0`; `_captured_frame.json` captured. Two wire-format corrections
  recorded in `docs/REFERENCES.md` and reconciled into the plan + `time_sync.py`: (1) frame `time` is a
  monotonic ms counter, not epoch ms (separate `timestamp` is wall-clock); (2) pushed frames carry
  `request: "get"` — detect frames by `values.frame` presence, not the request string.
- **Repo:** initialised and pushed (private, single-contributor). `main` branch protection is a
  deferred TODO (see `docs/HUMAN_TASKS.md`).
- **Phase 0 on-machine acceptance (2026-06-15):** `pip install -e .[dev]` into the Standalone OK;
  ruff/black/isort clean; pytest **10 passed / 2 skipped** — `test_eyetracker_class_loads_under_psychopy`
  passes, confirming the `EyeTrackerDevice` base path. **Discovery mechanism pinned** (via
  `check_discovery.py`): `scanPlugins()` sees the plugin; PsychoPy creates no importable `hw.eyetribe`
  module — ioHub resolves the device from the entry point at `launchHubServer` time
  (`eyetracker.hw.eyetribe.EyeTracker`); verified end-to-end in Phase 1/3.
- **REFERENCES filled from installed source (2026-06-15):** EyeTrackerDevice method surface (base
  provides event buffering → Phase 3 implements only device-specific methods); `BinocularEyeSampleEvent`
  field names + the Eye Tribe→event mapping; settings backend base class **`EyetrackerBackend`** —
  **`settings.py` corrected** from the wrong `EyetrackingBackend`. `default_eyetracker.yaml` filename
  confirmed in-tree. **Remaining for Phase 0:** one quick check that the in-tree MouseGaze device uses
  `supported_config_settings.yaml` (rename ours if not), then PR review/merge.
- **Fact-finding closed (2026-06-15):** MouseGaze device confirms both YAML filenames
  (`default_eyetracker.yaml` + `supported_config_settings.yaml`) — no rename; backend MRO confirms it
  subclasses `EyetrackerBackend`. **All `[TO CONFIRM]` items resolved.** Only the Phase 0 PR
  review/merge (human) remains before Phase 1.
